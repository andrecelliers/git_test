Welcome to Programming 1700 - Logic and Programming
===================================================

An introduction to the fundamentals of logic and computer programming, and the roles they play in creating software solutions for any problem. Logic is used to break down software instructions into
manageable tasks, to allow for comprehensive problem-solving using computer code. Programming is the act of creating the detailed instructions used by computers to perform any specified task or required behaviour. This
course covers the process of creating logical designs and implementing them as programmatic code to build computer software programs.

Throughout the course, **Python** will be used as the language of choice.  Examples may be shown from other languages.

Course Learning Outcomes
-------------------------

Learners are required to successfully complete each course outcome. In keeping with NSCCâ€™s approach to portfolio  learning, learners will have demonstrated the ability to:

   1. Translate logic principles into programming code to solve problems.
   2. Store data inside the various data structures of a software application to achieve any specified task.
   3. Build conditional tests in a software application to enact any required program behaviours.
   4. Use modular design principles to create software applications with increased efficiency and maintainable code.
   5. Design and implement iteration blocks within a software application to achieve efficiency of repetitive tasks.
   6. Design applications to acquire input from various sources and to provide output to a software application user.
