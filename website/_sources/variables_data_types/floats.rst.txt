Floats
======

A Float is similar to an :p:`int`, except it includes decimal places (i.e. :p:`pi = 3.14`).

Floats take up more memory (RAM) than integers in the Python program, so should only be used when needed.  If an :p:`int` will work, use it.  However, with modern computers having a significant amount of RAM, this is less of a concern than it was in the past.

Floats are declared in the same way as an :p:`int`:

.. code-block:: python
    
    pi = 3.14
    price = 10.99
    temperature = 21.05

As mentioned, a :p:`float` can be the quotient of two integers.  However, if any mathematical operation is performed and one of the numbers is a :p:`float`, the result will also be a :p:`float`.

.. code-block:: python

    numberOfItems = 5 # integer
    price = 10.99 #float
    totalPrice = numberOfItems * price # 54.95 will now be assigned to the "totalPrice" variable, which is a float
