Variables and Data Types
========================

The foundational building block of (all) programming languages are *variables*.  They are often described as "buckets" to novice programmers - a place where various data (values) can be stored and retrieved by the program while it executes.

Python has several different types of variables, each designed to hold a different kind of data.  These include:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   strings
   integers
   floats
   lists
   tuples
   dictionaries
